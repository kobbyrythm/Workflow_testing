**Q:** When I upload a file and fail with **'thatâ€™s a big file. Try again with a file smaller than 25MB.'**, what could I do?  
**A:** This is because github limits uploading a file larger than 25MB uploaded directly. Please use command to do it. You can clone the repo and place your PDF file in the dirctory **'Source'**, and then use git add . / git commit -m "comments" / git push origin gh-graphs to upload it. If you can not clone from or push onto the repo, please contact xxx to get the permission.
